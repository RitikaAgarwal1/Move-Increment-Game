It is a short game which has a 3x3 square and the top left most will be selected by default. The game can be played by using direction keys.

On pressing a direction key the Red selector mark will move 1 step towards that direction. For example if the square
(0,0) is selected, and if we press the ‘right’ key, then its adjacent square on the right will be selected, which means
(1, 0) will be selected.

Also when we move to a square, that very square’s value will be incremented by 1.

The current puzzle will be solved when all the squares have an equal value. In that case it should be shown that the
puzzle is solved. And the game will restart after few seconds.

The initial matrix values are hardcoded.

There is a restart button, if the player gets stuck then he/she can click and restart the game.
